FILE STRUCTURES
This contains files and report of my mini project on"BTREES ON HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT".

ABSTRACT
This project has been done using Eclipse IDE with the platform Windows and language JAVA.The database used for the project is 'Hospital'
records.A B-Tree is a balanced search tree.A B-Tree is a method of placing and locating files(called records or keys)in a database.
It uses bottom up approach.A B-Tree is designed to store sorted data and allows search,insertion and deletion operation to be
performed in logarithmic time.Access time in tree is dependent on the level of  the tree.So our aim is to minimize the access time which 
can be through balancing the tree.
